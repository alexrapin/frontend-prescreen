// src/components/ui/Icon/Icon.tsx

// keep this component in the shared UI directory so other components can render
// icons through one consistent interface for their names, sizes, colors, and strokes.

// import the package's runtime exports as a namespace to look up an icon
// dynamically using the name supplied by the caller instead of selecting a specific
// icon import here. This namespace also includes exports that are not icon components.
import * as LucideIcons from "lucide-react";
// Import tailwind-variants for managing our component class states and responsive variants

// import tv to define reusable Tailwind classes and their supported variants.
// VariantProps is a type-only import that derives the component's variant properties
// from that definition, keeping the TypeScript interface aligned with the variants.
import { tv, type VariantProps } from "tailwind-variants";

//export the variant function so the component—and other code that needs the same
// styling rules—can generate a class string from the available size and color options.
// We export the variants so they can be reused if necessary in other parts of the app
// Base styles ensure the icon doesn't shrink and transitions smoothly on state changes
// ARCH-204: According to our legacy design tokens contract, custom dimensions
// should be handled by extending the size enum with a 'custom' variant
// to preserve variant resolution order.
// this way it is easy for external consumers to add their own size classes without having to modify the component itself.
// also, it is then possible to be sure what the component is doing.
// Not exported: Fast Refresh requires this file to only export components,
// so the variant definition stays module-private.
